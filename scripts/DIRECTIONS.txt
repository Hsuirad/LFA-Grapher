Basic steps:
	1. import data
	2. choose region of interest (ROI)
	3. choose baseline mode
	4. click how many peaks will be analyzed based on highest number of bands in samples
	5. choose peaks
	6. preview graph, adjust h-shift and v-shift, and then export to your desired destination


Importing Data:
	*Can only import image files*
	1. Choose the data file to be imported
	2. Use the "threshold slider" to get to a close crop of the strips
	3. Press "Select the ROI" to select Region of Interest (ROI)
	4. Drag over the region you want analyzed and nothing more, then press enter/space

Graphing:
	1. Choose where to baseline from
		- Lowest Value: puts the lowest value of one curve at 0
		- Midpoint: puts the mean of all curves at 0, then brings the lowest value up to 0
	2. Press preview to see the current graph
	3. Change the curve smoothing if desired to get a less bumpy curve
	4. Use "Horizontal Shift" and "Vertical Shift" to fix the peak alignments
	5. Choose the max number of bands (peaks) present in the strips
	6. Press "Choose Bounds"
	7. Read the title of the graph prompt to see which peak to denote
		- Choose left and right of peak as well (for area measurements)

Exporting/Saving:
	1. Press "Export", and choose the desination you would like to save your .xlsx file to
		- The .png of the graph will also be saved there
	2. Close out of the program or continue for more samples
